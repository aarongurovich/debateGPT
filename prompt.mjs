The constant updates, new seasons, and the fact that it's free-to-play makes it appealing for everyone. Plus, the battle royale format is just pure excitement—you never know what’s going to happen next! Eitan: Well, Rocket League is more skill-based. It’s soccer with cars, which is just cool. You don't have to deal with all that building stuff like in Fortnite, and it’s straightforward—just get the ball in the goal. Simple. Aaron: But that’s the thing! Fortnite is more than just simplicity—it’s complex in the best way. You have to think on your feet, manage resources, and be good at shooting and building at the same time. It gives you the freedom to play in your style. Rocket League, on the other hand, is pretty repetitive. It’s the same thing over and over again—score goals with cars. There’s not much variety. Eitan: Yeah, but at least in Rocket League, everyone is on the same playing field. No one’s going to just build a tower in front of you and trap you like in Fortnite. It’s all about pure driving skills, you know? Aaron: Sure, but that limits the creativity. In Fortnite, you have endless possibilities with each game. You can outsmart your opponents in multiple ways—whether it’s by building, ambushing, or using different weapons and traps. Rocket League doesn’t give you that kind of flexibility. You’re just driving around hoping to hit the ball. Eitan: Well, Rocket League has... esports! It’s huge in the competitive scene, way bigger than Fortnite. Aaron: Actually, Fortnite has a massive esports following too. Did you forget about the Fortnite World Cup? A 16-year-old won millions of dollars! And the viewership for Fortnite is insane on platforms like Twitch. So in terms of competition and esports, Fortnite holds its own easily. Plus, Fortnite appeals to a much wider audience with its collaborations with pop culture icons, movies, and even concerts inside the game. Eitan: Uh, yeah, but... Rocket League... it’s more realistic? Aaron: Realistic? We’re talking about cars flying through the air hitting giant soccer balls! Fortnite might not be realistic either, but at least it doesn’t try to be. Fortnite embraces the craziness, and that’s part of what makes it fun. Plus, Rocket League doesn’t have the constant updates or variety of content that Fortnite offers. It gets stale fast. Eitan: Okay, but Rocket League is just easier to get into. You don’t have to worry about all that complex stuff like in Fortnite. Aaron: Sure, it’s easier, but that’s what makes Fortnite more rewarding. It has a higher skill ceiling. The more you play, the better you get, and you can really see your improvement over time. Rocket League might be easy to pick up, but Fortnite is challenging in a way that keeps you coming back for more. Eitan: Well... at least Rocket League doesn’t have all those annoying emotes. Aaron: Yeah, but that’s part of Fortnite’s charm! The emotes are fun and let players express themselves. It adds personality to the game, and honestly, who doesn’t enjoy doing a victory dance after winning a battle royale?",
